# Event Booking System

This is a full-stack event booking system built as part of a technical task. The system allows users to browse, book, and manage event reservations, while admins can manage all events through an integrated admin panel.

> Minor change made: Instead of labeling an event as "Booked," users now have the ability to cancel the booking if already booked.
